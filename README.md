# Medified-Health-Assistant
Medified is an instant medical checkup service. It will predict the chances of getting disease to the patient by collecting patients health conditions as input.Using machine learning we built models for some diseases to predict health condition of the patient through a series of inputs from the patient.

*You can check the demo of the project by [clicking here](https://yoonus47.github.io/Medified/)*

# Key Features
1) Nice UI to make user-friendly.
